# 🧠 Search Algorithm Visualizer

A real-time interactive visualization tool for classical search algorithms (BFS, DFS, IDS, Greedy Best-First, A* Energy-Optimal, and A* Path-Optimal).  
This project helps users understand how search algorithms explore a state space through step-by-step graphical animations.

## 🎯 Features

### 🔍 Supported Search Algorithms
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
- **IDS (Iterative Deepening Search)**
- **Greedy Best-First Search**
- **A\* (Energy-Optimal)**
- **A\* (Path-Optimal)**

Each algorithm logs its execution into structured `VisualizationStep` objects, enabling smooth animation.
